However, you can get a lot of mileage out of refining and using the sklearn libraries that we discussed yesterday. A good workflow is to try simple answers first and move into more advanced techniques as your use-case requires -- your goals as modelers should be to make best choice that you can, contingent on time and use-case. Having something work, but not be 100% correct is better than having something 100% correct that doesn't work yet. "

During a larger project, we will likely spend days if not weeks on feature extraction and analysis and will want to make as many useful features as possible to make as good a model as possible. Other techniques may involve more nuanced modeling, such as looking at the sequence of parts of speech, etc. Part of this lesson is designed to expose to what is out there so that when faced with a situation where those techniques may be useful, you're aware of their existence."

    "We begin by picking a set of documents and a number of topics that we want to generate. One way that we do this is what's known as collapsed Gibbs saampling. We do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly assign every word in every document to one of the $k$ topics:\n",
    "    - $w$: a word in a document\n",
    "    - $d$: a document\n",
    "    - $k$: a topic\n",

    "3. Iterate through every word in every document and:\n",
    "    1. Assume that every other word has the correct likelihood that they belong to each topic (so, `apple` might have a distribution of `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2]` for five topics.\n",
    "    2. Look at the likelihood of seeing word $w$ in document $d$ and adjust the topic probabilities as needed\n",

You start visiting different places around town (the park, the library, the mall, etc.) and noting who's there. Everytime you go to a place you start adjusting your expectation on who you'll see there (such as the goths constantly are at the mall, so we should expect less and less that they'll show up at the library). This is (very roughly) analgous to what LDA is doing.\n",
